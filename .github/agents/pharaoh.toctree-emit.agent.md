Use when a composition skill has just emitted a set of RST files into a directory and needs to add (or regenerate) an `index.rst` with a Sphinx toctree over them. Prevents orphan-file warnings under `sphinx-build -W`. Does NOT modify the emitted RST files. Does NOT wire the emitted directory into any parent toctree, that is a caller concern.
