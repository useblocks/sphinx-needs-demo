# @pharaoh.feat-review

Use when auditing a single feature-level need (feat) against the generic feat review axes in `shared/checklists/feat.md` plus any per-project addenda in `.pharaoh/project/checklists/feat.md`. Emits structured findings JSON — per-axis pass/fail for mechanized axes, 0-3 score for subjective axes. Mirrors `pharaoh-req-review`'s shape for feat-level artefacts.

## Full atomic specification

# pharaoh-feat-review

## When to use

Invoke after `pharaoh-feat-draft-from-docs` emitted a feat, or on an existing feat need-id in needs.json. Part of the self-review invariant — see [`shared/self-review-invariant.md`](https://github.com/useblocks/pharaoh/blob/v1.2.0/skills/shared/self-review-invariant.md).

Do NOT review comp_reqs or architecture — use `pharaoh-req-review` or `pharaoh-arch-review`. Do NOT re-author — invoke `pharaoh-feat-draft-from-docs` again with the review findings as input if regeneration is needed.

## Atomicity

- (a) One feat + one checklist in → one findings JSON out.
- (b) Input: `{target: <feat_directive_rst_or_need_id>, checklist_path: <path>, tailoring_path: <path>}`. Output: findings JSON with per-axis entries.
- (c) Reward: fixtures mirror `pharaoh-req-review` — one `passing.rst` and one `failing.rst` feat with expected findings JSON.
- (d) Reusable by any flow emitting feats.
- (e) Read-only.

## Input

- `target`: RST directive block for a feat, OR a `need_id` with `type: feat` present in needs.json.
- `checklist_path`: absolute path to `shared/checklists/feat.md`. Per-project extensions in `.pharaoh/project/checklists/feat.md` are appended if present.
- `tailoring_path`: absolute path to `.pharaoh/project/` root. Reads `artefact-catalog.yaml` for required/optional fields per the feat artefact type.

## Output

```json

  "need_id": "FEAT_example",

  },

```

## Review axes

See [`shared/checklists/feat.md`](https://github.com/useblocks/pharaoh/blob/v1.2.0/skills/shared/checklists/feat.md) for the canonical axis list and rubric. Per-project extensions (e.g. Score's ASIL-level guidance, connector-family consistency (project-specific example)) are appended from `.pharaoh/project/checklists/feat.md` if present, with their own axis keys namespaced under `tailoring.*`.

## Composition

Invoked by `pharaoh-write-plan`-generated plans after every `pharaoh-feat-draft-from-docs` task. Also invoked ad-hoc per the self-review invariant. Coverage enforced by `pharaoh-self-review-coverage-check`.
