# @pharaoh.fmea-review

Use when auditing a single FMEA entry (failure-mode row) against the generic FMEA review axes in `shared/checklists/fmea.md` plus per-project addenda. Checks severity/occurrence/detection scales, RPN computation, cause/effect well-formedness, traceability to the analyzed artefact. Emits structured findings JSON.

## Full atomic specification

# pharaoh-fmea-review

## When to use

Invoke after `pharaoh-fmea` emitted a single failure-mode entry. Part of the self-review invariant.

Do NOT review sets of FMEA rows — this skill reviews one entry. A fleet review is a separate flow that invokes this skill per entry.

## Atomicity

- (a) One FMEA entry + one checklist in → one findings JSON out.
- (b) Input: `{target: <fmea_entry_json_or_need_id>, checklist_path: <path>, tailoring_path: <path>}`. Output: findings JSON.
- (c) Reward: fixtures `passing-fmea.json` + `failing-fmea.json` with expected findings.
- (d) Reusable.
- (e) Read-only.

## Input

- `target`: JSON object with the FMEA entry shape emitted by `pharaoh-fmea`, OR a need_id with type `fmea` in needs.json.
- `checklist_path`: `shared/checklists/fmea.md`.
- `tailoring_path`: `.pharaoh/project/` for optional scale extensions.

## Output

```json
