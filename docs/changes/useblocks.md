## change file
Love the change-file idea, which is a working document and memorize the current status of a change.
This allows multiple users to work on it over days and store the reasoning.

The change file gets quite huge. Hard to follow everything in an acceptable time.
--> Q: How to get quicker insights and overviews of written docs like this?

## ui
I think the interface is the best qwe can do in VS Code and file based.
However, in a Web UI the change file could be separeted and stored to the different objects directly. Would allow to easier get the overview.
