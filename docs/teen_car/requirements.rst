.. req:: Safety Features
   :id: TEEN_SAFE
   :tags: teen, safe
   :author: ROBERT
   :release: REL_TEEN_2024_6
   :status: open

   The car must include advanced safety features such as automatic braking, collision avoidance systems, and adaptive cruise control to ensure the safety of teenage drivers.

.. req:: Connectivity and Entertainment
   :id: TEEN_CON
   :tags: teen, connection
   :author: ROBERT, PETER
   :release: REL_TEEN_2025_6

.. req:: Customization Options
   :id: TEEN_CUSTOM
   :tags: teen, customization
   :author: PETER
   :release: REL_TEEN_2024_6
   :status: closed
 
   The car must offer a range of customization options, including exterior colors, interior finishes, and optional accessories, allowing teenagers to personalize their vehicles to reflect their individual styles and preferences.

.. req:: Fuel Efficiency
   :id: TEEN_EFF
   :tags: teen, efficiency
   :author: ROBERT
   :release: REL_TEEN_2025_1
   :status: closed
   
   The car should prioritize fuel efficiency, with a focus on eco-friendly technologies such as hybrid or electric powertrains, to minimize environmental impact and reduce operating costs for teenage drivers.

.. req:: User-Friendly Interface
   :id: TEEN_USER
   :tags: teen, user
   :author: ROBERT
   :release: REL_TEEN_2025_1
   :status: new

   The car's interface should be intuitive and easy to use, with a touchscreen infotainment system, voice recognition capabilities, and simplified controls to enhance the driving experience for teenage users.


.. req:: Customer-specific RADAR configuration
   :id: TEEN_CUSTOMER
   :tags: teen, customer
   :author: customer_a:ROBERT, customer_b:SARAH
   :release: REL_TEEN_2025_1
   :status: customer_a:open, customer_b:closed
   :customer: B

   We need to adapt the configuration of our RADAR system depending on the final customer.

   .. tip:: 
      :title: Demo feature hint: Variant handling
      :collapsible: 
   
      This Requirement is using variant handling.
      Depending on the value of the ``customer`` option (``A`` or ``B``), status and author get updated.

      The variant matrix looks like this:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :stub-columns: 1

         - * customer
           * author
           * status
         - * A
           * ROBERT
           * open
         - * B
           * SARAH
           * closed


      | The used code for the options is:
      | **author**: ``customer_a:ROBERT, customer_b:SARAH``
      | **status**: ``customer_a:open, customer_b:closed``

      The value of ``customer`` in this example is: **[[copy("customer")]]**. Therefore ``author`` is finally **[[copy("author")]]** and ``status`` is **[[copy("status")]]**.

      Setting values of options can be done dynamically and triggered from outside. So different build commands could result in a totally different document thanks
      to the used ``needs_variant`` feature.


.. req:: Autonomous Driving 
   :id: TEEN_AUTO
   
   The autonomous driving system integrated into the teenager's vehicle must encompass a robust sensor suite 
   comprising lidar, radar, cameras, and ultrasonic sensors to provide comprehensive environmental perception. 
   Utilizing deep learning algorithms, the system should enable real-time object detection, classification, 
   and trajectory prediction for efficient obstacle avoidance. It should employ a hierarchical control architecture, 
   incorporating motion planning algorithms such as MPC (Model Predictive Control) to ensure smooth and 
   safe trajectory tracking. Additionally, the system must support secure communication protocols for remote 
   monitoring and control, allowing guardians to access and manage settings through a secure web interface.
