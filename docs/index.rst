   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Sphinx-Needs Demo
=================

This is a demo documentation for showing the features of `Sphinx-Needs <https://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

      A simple Automotive SW project is used as playground, with elements for:

      * Requirements
      * Specifications
      * Implementations
      * Test Cases
      * and Test Results

         Open this playground in an Online Editor!

Architecture diagrams get described by PlantUML.

There are also Dashboard pages to show specific information for different process roles.

The complete source code can be found here: https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-needs-demo

Features and technical details are described inside dropdowns like this one:

   :title: Demo feature hint: Just an example
   :collapsible:

   Really, this is just an example. Nothing more.


Demo Content
------------
Most of the need content was created using AI. Also most of the images were generated this way.

However, all the meta-data, configuration, and analysis were set by hand, so that the setup shows 
examples of a real-world use cases and solutions.

Demo Status
-----------
This demo page is an early alpha version.
The chapter of :ref:`teen_car` is mostly complete in terms of configuration and show cases, even if the amount
of requirements and co. is quite small.

Demo playground
---------------
This Demo includes also a specialized docs-as-code setup for a Gitpod online IDE.

You can open it by simply clicking this link:
`Gitpod Sphinx-Needs-Demo IDE <gitpod.io/#https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-needs-demo>`__.

A login with a Gitpod or GitHub account is needed. After this, you can use 
the online IDE for 50 hours per month for free.

The Gitpod IDE provides the following features:

* Automatical clone of the requested repository
* Starting a selected docker container and using it as the build environment
* Install all needed Python dependencies (Sphinx + extensions)
* Load preconfigured VS Code extensions (Restructured text support, Esbonio, Previewer)
* Launch configuration to build the Sphinx demo project

ToDo
----

* ☑ Dashboard and Analysis page (tables, flowcharts, pies)
* ☑ Template for need objects, showing connected objects (for reqs and specs)
* ☑ Code API example and linking
* ☑ Sphinx-Preview or alternative
* ☐ Much more content
* ☐ SW Architecture example
* ☐ Sphinx-Build documentation
* ☑ ``needs_constraints`` example
* ☑ ``conf.py`` integration and details
* ☐ CI integration (☑ Read the docs, checks and GitHub action missing)
* ☐ PDF build (postponed, as a build with Sphinx-SimpledPDF needs special handling because of images and used Sphinx-Design grids)
* ☐ Add a drawio example
* ☑ Example for variant handling
* ☐ List of single features, plus explanation and link to doc, where it is used.
* ☐ Nested Needs Example
* ☐ Better Example data. We need to kind of examples. One for all skill-levels, one for Automotive managers

  * All-Skill-Level: Feature-based development of a Rocket (Req,Specs, Tests all on one feature-page)
  * Automotive: ECU-dev by V-model. Per type one file/folder
