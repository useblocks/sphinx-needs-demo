      The source code of the Sphinx-Needs-Demo project can be loaded automatically in a preconfigured
      VS Code instance on Gitpod, which allows to change data, test some features and see the outcome as a preview
      in the browser. And this all without any installation or costs on your side.

Start the Online Editor
-----------------------

.. hint::

   It may take 1-2 minutes to start the Online Editor (~20s), update the environment (30s) and
   build the docs for the first time(20s). After this is done, the workspace start and usage is much faster. 

#. Open the following link in your browser:
   https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-needs-demo
#. You are asked to log in with a Gitpod or Github account.
#. An instance is started, which

   #. Checks out the Sphinx-Needs-Demo repository.
   #. Installs all needed dependencies for the operating system and the Python environment.
   #. Loads preconfigured VS Code extensions, to support you with the development of the documentation.
   #. Start an initial documentation build.
   #. Shows the documentation build result as a preview in a browser.

After everything is running:

#. Feel free to edit and save any file under ``docs``.
#. With each change, the docs get built automatically and you can see the result in the preview, after refreshing the page 
   (normally by pressing ``F5``).

Share your docs
---------------

Your specific build of the Sphinx-Needs-Demo project is public available and can be shared 
with colleagues and other users around the world, as long as your Gitpod instance is running.

You can get the link by opening the "ports" tab and copy the address entry for the port "8000".
