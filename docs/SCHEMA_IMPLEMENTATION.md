# Schema Validation Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

This document summarizes the schema validation feature added to the Sphinx-Needs Demo project.

## Validation Rules Implemented

### ID Pattern Validation (Severity: info)
- Requirements: `R_*`, `SWREQ_*`, or `REQ_*`
- Specifications: `S_*` or `SPEC_*`
- Implementations: `I_*`, `IMPL_*`, or `GH_PR_*`
- Tests: `T_*` or `TEST_*`
- Persons: `P_*` or uppercase names
- SW Architecture: `SWARCH_*`
- SW Requirements: `SWREQ_*` or `GH_ISSUE_*`

### Automotive ADAS Requirements (Severity: warning)
- **Status Required**: Must have valid status set
- **Release Required**: Must be linked to at least one release

### Network Link Validation (Severity: info)
- Specifications should link to requirements via `reqs`
- Implementations should link to specifications via `implements`
- Tests should link to specs or implementations

### Metadata Validation (Severity: info)
- Persons should have roles defined
- Teams should have persons assigned

## Benefits

1. **Data Quality**: Enforces consistent naming conventions and required fields
2. **Traceability**: Validates proper linking between requirement artifacts
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages guide users to fix issues
4. **Performance**: Fast validation doesn't impact build times
5. **Flexibility**: Severity levels allow gradual adoption (info → warning → violation)
6. **Automation**: Validation runs automatically during every build
7. **IDE Support**: Compatible with ubCode extension for real-time validation
