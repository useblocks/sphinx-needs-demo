SYS.4 Integration Test Cases
============================

This document provides validation test cases to ensure the architectural elements defined in 
SYS.3 function as intended.

.. test:: Lane Detection Validation
   :id: TEST_SYS_INT_001
   :links: ARCH_001

   Validate the lane detection architecture by ensuring proper integration of camera input processing and steering correction modules.

.. test:: Adaptive Cruise Control Validation
   :id: TEST_SYS_INT_002
   :links: ARCH_002

   Validate the adaptive cruise control architecture to ensure accurate distance measurement and dynamic speed adjustments.

.. test:: Collision Avoidance Validation
   :id: TEST_SYS_INT_003
   :links: ARCH_003

   Validate the collision avoidance system to confirm effective interaction between collision risk estimation and emergency braking subsystems.

.. test:: Pedestrian Detection Validation
   :id: TEST_SYS_INT_004
   :links: ARCH_004

   Validate the pedestrian detection architecture, ensuring seamless operation of detection, path prediction, and alert mechanisms.

.. test:: Alert System Validation
   :id: TEST_SYS_INT_005
   :links: ARCH_005

   Validate the alert mechanism framework by integrating and testing audio, visual, and haptic feedback systems.

.. test:: Emergency Braking Validation
   :id: TEST_SYS_INT_006
   :links: ARCH_006

   Validate the emergency braking architecture to confirm efficient response times and optimized braking force for pedestrian safety.
