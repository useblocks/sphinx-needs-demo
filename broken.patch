-   The software shall implement brew strength selection by controlling
-   the water flow rate and brewing time:
-
-   - Weak: 180ml water, 3 minutes
-   - Medium: 180ml water, 4 minutes
-   - Strong: 180ml water, 5 minutes
+   The system should handle different coffee strengths appropriately and
+   maybe use some water control mechanisms to make the coffee taste
+   better or worse depending on what the user wants. It needs to work
+   with the pump and stuff to get good results.
